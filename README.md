[autoRemote.js](http://github.com/kai-wegner/autoRemote.js)
======

A node.js Module for communication with the AutoApps-Ecosystem developed by Jo√£o Dias based on AutoRemote.
I hope we can develop a plug&play Linux and Mac OS X Client which can be extended by plugins.
Currently this is only a POC and early alpha stage

### Use

DO NOT USE! Developers only ATM. Send me a message and we will keep you updated.
At the moment the only thing you can do is execute the autoRemote file in the "bin"-directory to test some stuff.

### Install

npm install autoremote.js
